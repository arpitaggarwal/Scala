{"name":"Scala","tagline":"Scala","body":"## Scala.Any\r\n* **Class Any is the root of the Scala class hierarchy**. Every class in a Scala execution environment inherits directly or \r\n  indirectly from this class.\r\n* Starting with Scala 2.10 it is possible to directly extend Any using universal traits. A universal trait is a trait that \r\n  extends Any, only has defs as members, and does no initialization.\r\n* The superclass of all classes scala. **Any has two direct subclasses scala.AnyVal and scala.AnyRef** representing two \r\n  different class worlds: value classes and reference classes.\r\n* All value classes are predefined; they correspond to the primitive types of Java-like languages. \r\n* All other classes define reference types. User-defined classes define reference types by default; i.e. they always   \r\n  (indirectly) subclass scala.AnyRef. \r\n* Every user-defined class in Scala implicitly extends the trait scala.ScalaObject. Classes from the infrastructure on \r\n  which Scala is running (e.g. the Java runtime environment) do not extend scala.ScalaObject. If Scala is used in the \r\n  context of a Java runtime environment, then scala.AnyRef corresponds to java.lang.Object.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
